Description: When moving from Next.js 12 ---> 13, there are new defaults to be aware of. 
This is meant to be a helpful guide for all the defaults in Next.js13 


1. Next.js 13 components are React Server Components by Default. React Server Components cannot be used in Next.js 12.
2. In Next.js 13 create-next-app now ships with TypeScript by default. 
3. Next.js 13's image component (next/image) is equivalent to the next/future/image in Next.12. The next/future/image improvements are now the default for next/image
4. Next.js 13's layouts are React Server Components by default, including the root layout. 
5. Next.js 13's layouts in a route are nested by default 
6. By default, layouts in the file hierarchy are nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their children prop.
7. Routes are prefetched as they become visible in the viewport when using the <Link> component by default 
8. The app directory uses the Node.js runtime, which is also the default for Serverless functions. 
9. By default, Next.js will cache the result of fetch() requests that do not specifically opt out of caching behavior. 
10. By default, Next.js automatically does static fetches.
11. The default behavior of next/script allows you load third-party scripts in any page or layout, you can fine-tune its loading behavior by using the strategy property
